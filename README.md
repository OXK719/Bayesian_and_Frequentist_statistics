# Fundamental_distributions
This code is written in python. 

Each program uses example data that can be found in the same folder or is generated within the code itself.

The Least-squares_fitting program shows how a least-squares fit may be generated for either variable x against y or variable y against x (or in the case of this program, displacement and time). Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated 

The Bayesian-model-selection program uses Bayesian statistical methods to asses which of three model best represent example data. The data is 'collected' over 10hr, 24hr and 100hr so that we may asses how our model selection may change as more data is introduced.

A cumulative distribution is plotted for some example data and compared to expectation for the distribution of luminosities of stars.
